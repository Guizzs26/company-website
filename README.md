# First HTML and CSS Landing Page

> The aim of this project was mainly to put flexbox and layout construction into practice. I also put into practice some transition effects, the use of pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes and element styling in general. The logo I created in Canva, the color palette I used > > Open Color for inspiration and the image i took from the unDrawn website. 🚀

**It's a generic landing page, don't take the content into account.**
